                        <h4>d. Tutorial sessions – Hands-on training</h4>
                        <p>Hands-on training is essential for holistic learning and skill development, providing
                            participants with valuable experiences, practical skills, and confidence needed for success
                            in their academic and professional endeavours. Hands-on training is of paramount importance
                            for several reasons:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li></li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li> &nbsp;○ &nbsp; Active Learning: Hands-on training engages participants actively in
                                    the learning process. It allows them to apply theoretical knowledge in practical
                                    scenarios, reinforcing concepts and enhancing understanding.</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;○ &nbsp; Skill Development: Practical experience enables individuals to
                                    develop and refine skills relevant to their field of study or profession. Whether
                                    it's technical skills, problem-solving abilities, or critical thinking, hands-on
                                    training provides opportunities for skill acquisition and mastery.
                                </li>
                                <li>&nbsp;○ &nbsp; Real-World Application: Hands-on training bridges the gap between
                                    theory and practice by allowing participants to experience real-world scenarios.
                                    This practical exposure helps learners understand how concepts and skills are
                                    applied in professional settings, preparing them for future challenges and
                                    opportunities.</li>

                                <li>&nbsp;○ &nbsp;Retention and Recall: Research has shown that active learning methods,
                                    such as hands-on training, improve retention and recall of information. By actively
                                    engaging with the material through practical exercises and experiences, participants
                                    are more likely to remember and apply what they have learnt.</li>

                                <li>&nbsp;○ &nbsp; Confidence Building: Hands-on training builds confidence and
                                    self-efficacy. As participants gain hands-on experience and see tangible results,
                                    they become more confident in their abilities and more willing to take on new
                                    challenges.</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;○ &nbsp; Problem-Solving Skills: Practical training often involves
                                    troubleshooting and problem-solving, which are essential skills in any field.
                                    Through hands-on exercises, participants learn to identify issues, analyze problems,
                                    and develop effective solutions, enhancing their problem-solving capabilities.</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;○ &nbsp; Teamwork and Collaboration: Many hands-on training activities involve
                                    teamwork and collaboration, fostering interpersonal skills and teamwork abilities.
                                    Participants learn to communicate effectively, work cooperatively with others, and
                                    leverage collective strengths to achieve common goals.</li>
                                <li>&nbsp;○ &nbsp; Adaptability and Flexibility: Practical training exposes participants
                                    to diverse situations and scenarios, helping them develop adaptability and
                                    flexibility. By encountering various challenges and working through different
                                    scenarios, learners become more resilient and adaptable to change.</li>
